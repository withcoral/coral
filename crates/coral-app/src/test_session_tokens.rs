//! Test-only session-token minting for sibling crates' integration tests.
//!
//! Gated behind the `test-session-tokens` feature, which production builds must
//! leave off: this mints an access token for any subject without an OAuth flow.
//! An out-of-crate test uses it so it exercises the real issuer's wire format
//! instead of re-implementing the JWT the verifier expects — a hand-assembled
//! token can drift from the issuer and let the test pass while serving is
//! broken.
